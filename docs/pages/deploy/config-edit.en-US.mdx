# Editing Configuration Files

When running a service, you can use a configuration file to customize some parameters of the service. Zeabur provides a configuration file editor that allows you to specify the storage location and content of the configuration file via the editor. When the service starts, the configuration file is automatically mounted.

Here, we use [nginx](https://nginx.com/) as a front proxy for [Botway CE](https://github.com/botwayorg/ce) to demonstrate the process of editing ngnix custom configuration files via the configuration file editor.

## Step One: Create a Project

Create a Project in [Zeabur Dash](https://dash.zeabur.com/).

## Step Two: Create Services

Create Prebuilt Services in the Project mentioned above, with service names `nginx` and `botway` respectively.

## Step 3: Edit Nginx Service Configuration File

1. In the Services column, click on the `Settings` tab for the `nginx` service, click the drop-down button to find the `Configs` section, and click the `Open Config Editor` button to enter the configuration file editor.

2. In the opened window, click the `Add Config file` button to add a configuration file. In the popped-up window, enter the path and name of the configuration file in the `Config Path` input box. Here, we input `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf`, and then click the `Save Config` button.

    The `Config Path` above requires you to input the absolute path of the configuration file, please configure it according to the actual situation.

3. Edit the content of the configuration file according to your needs. Here, we add a `server` configuration for reverse proxying the Botway CE service.

```nginx
worker_processes  5;
error_log  stderr;
worker_rlimit_nofile 8192;

events {}

http {
  default_type application/octet-stream;
  log_format   main '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local]  $status '
    '"$request" $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
    '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';
  access_log   /dev/stdout  main;
  sendfile     on;
  tcp_nopush   on;
  server_names_hash_bucket_size 128; # this seems to be required for some vhosts

  server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    server_name _;

    location / {
      add_header X-Demo-By zeabur;
    
      proxy_pass http://botway-ce.zeabur.internal:8080;
    }
  }
}
```
In the file content above, `botway-ce.zeabur.internal` in the `proxy_pass` directive is the service name of Botway CE. Here, we used [Private Network](/deploy/private-networking) feature, which allows us to access services via a fixed host name using internal network access.

In the file above, we added a custom log format and log storage location, as well as several custom nginx optimization parameters.

4. Click the `Save` button to save the configuration file.

## Step Four: Restart the Service

In the steps above, we have finished editing the configuration file. Next, we need to restart the service. Go to the Instructions column, find the `Restart` button, and click it to restart the service so that the configuration file takes effect.
