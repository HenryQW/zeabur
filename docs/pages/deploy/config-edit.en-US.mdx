# Editing Configuration Files

When running a service, you can use a configuration file to customize some parameters of the service. Zeabur provides a configuration file editor that can specify the storage location and content of the configuration file through the editor. When the service starts, the configuration file is automatically mounted.

Here, we use [nginx](https://nginx.com/) as a front proxy for [vaultwarden](https://github.com/dani-garcia/vaultwarden) to demonstrate the process of editing ngnix custom configuration files via the configuration file editor.

## Step One: Create a Project

Create a Project in [Zeabur Dash](https://dash.zeabur.com/).

## Step Two: Create Services

Create Prebuilt Services in the aforementioned Project , with service names namely nginx and vaultwarden.

![Create Vaultwarden Service](/deploy/config-edit/create-vultwarden-service.en-US.png)

## Step Three: Edit Nginx Service Configuration File

1. In the Services column, click `Settings` tab for the nginx service, click the drop-down button to find the `Configs` section, and click the `Open Config Editor` button to enter the configuration file editor.

2. In the opened window, click the `Add Config file` button, to add a configuration file. In the popped-up window, input the path and name of the configuration file in the `Config Path` input box. Here, we input `/etc/nginx/nginx.conf` and click the `Save Config` button.

    The `Config Path` above requires the absolute path of the configuration file, please configure in line with the actual situation.
</Callout>

3. Depending on the requirements, edit the content of the configuration file. Here, we add a `server` configuration for reverse-proxying the vaultwarden service.

```nginx
worker_processes  4;
error_log  stderr;
worker_rlimit_nofile 8192;

events {}

http {
  default_type application/octet-stream;
  log_format   main '$remote_addr - $remote_user [$time_local]  $status '
    '"$request" $body_bytes_sent "$http_referer" '
    '"$http_user_agent" "$http_x_forwarded_for"';
  access_log   /dev/stdout  main;
  sendfile     on;
  tcp_nopush   on;
  server_names_hash_bucket_size 128; # this seems to be required for some vhosts

  map $http_upgrade $connection_upgrade {
    default upgrade;
    ''      "";
  }

  server {
    listen 80 default_server;
    server_name _; 

    location / {
      proxy_http_version 1.1;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection $connection_upgrade;
    
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
      proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
      proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto $scheme;
    
      proxy_pass http://vaultwarden.zeabur.internal:80;
    }
  }
}
```
In the file content above, `vaultwarden.zeabur.internal` in the `proxy_pass` block is the service name of Vaultwarden. Here, we used [Private Network](/deploy/private-networking) feature, which allows to access services through a fixed host name using an internal network.

In the file above, we added a custom log format and log storage location, in addition to several custom nginx optimization parameters.

4. Click the `Save` button to save the configuration file.

## Step Four: Restart the Service

In the above steps, we already concluded the editing of the configuration file. Next, we need to restart the service, find the `Instructions` column, find the `Restart` button, and click to restart the service in order for the configuration file to take effect.

After [binding the domain name](/deploy/domain-binding) under the nginx service, you can access the vaultwarden service through the domain name.
